abstract="The paper presents research on the influence of the numbers of bins, found for attributes in supervised discretisation for input sets, on classifiers performance. Firstly, the variables were divided into categories defined by numbers of bins, and for these categories several decision systems were tested. Secondly, for features with single bins, unsupervised discretisation was executed and the resulting performance studied. The experiments show usefulness of characterisation of variables by numbers of bins, and cases of improvement of solutions by combining supervised with unsupervised discretisation.",

abstract="Ranking is a strategy widely used for estimating relevance or importance of available characteristic features. Depending on the applied methodology, variables are assessed individually or as subsets, by some statistics referring to information theory, machine learning algorithms, or specialised procedures that execute systematic search through the feature space. The information about importance of attributes can be used in the pre-processing step of initial data preparation, to remove irrelevant or superfluous elements. It can also be employed in post-processing, for optimisation of already constructed classifiers. The chapter describes research on the latter approach, involving filtering inferred decision rules while exploiting ranking positions and scores of features. The optimised rule classifiers were applied in the domain of stylometric analysis of texts for the task of binary authorship attribution.",

abstract="Feature extraction is the first step in building real-life classification engines---it aims at elaborating features to characterize objects that are to be labeled by a trained model. Time-consuming feature extraction requires domain expertise to effectively design features. Deep neural networks (DNNs) appeared as a remedy in this context---their shallow layers perform representation learning, being an automated discovery of various-level features that robustly represent objects. However, the representations that are being learnt are still extremely difficult to interpret, and DNNs are prone to memorizing small datasets. In this paper, we introduce evolvable deep features (EDFs)---a DNN is used to extract automatic features that undergo genetic feature selection. Such evolved features are fed into a supervised learner. The experiments, backed up with statistical tests, performed on multi- and binary-class sets showed that our approach automatically learns object representations, greatly reduces the number of features without deteriorating the performance of trained models, and can even boost their classification performance.",

ABSTRACT = {Most naturally-occurring physical phenomena are examples of nonlinear dynamic systems, the functioning of which attracts many researchers seeking to unveil their nature. The research presented in this paper is aimed at exploring eye movement dynamic features in terms of the existence of chaotic nature. Nonlinear time series analysis methods were used for this purpose. Two time series features were studied: fractal dimension and entropy, by utilising the embedding theory. The methods were applied to the data collected during the experiment with “jumping point” stimulus. Eye movements were registered by means of the Jazz-novo eye tracker. One thousand three hundred and ninety two (1392) time series were defined, based on the horizontal velocity of eye movements registered during imposed, prolonged fixations. In order to conduct detailed analysis of the signal and identify differences contributing to the observed patterns of behaviour in time scale, fractal dimension and entropy were evaluated in various time series intervals. The influence of the noise contained in the data and the impact of the utilized filter on the obtained results were also studied. The low pass filter was used for the purpose of noise reduction with a 50 Hz cut-off frequency, estimated by means of the Fourier transform and all concerned methods were applied to time series before and after noise reduction. These studies provided some premises, which allow perceiving eye movements as observed chaotic data: characteristic of a space-time separation plot, low and non-integer time series dimension, and the time series entropy characteristic for chaotic systems.},

Its main objective is to minimize the number of vehicles, and the secondary objective is to minimize the distance traveled during the service. In this paper, we propose the longest common subsequence based selective route exchange crossover (LCS-SREX), and apply this operator in the memetic algorithm (MA) for the PDPTW. Also, we suggest the new solution representation which helps handle the crossover efficiently. Extensive experimental study performed on the benchmark set showed that using LCS-SREX leads to very high-quality feasible solutions. The analysis is backed with the statistical tests to verify the importance of the elaborated results. Finally, we report one new world's best routing schedule found using a parallel version of the MA exploiting LCS-SREX.",

abstract="Support vector machines (SVMs) have been found highly helpful in solving numerous pattern recognition tasks. Although it is challenging to train SVMs from large data sets, this obstacle may be mitigated by selecting a small, yet representative, subset of the entire training set. Another crucial and deeply-investigated problem consists in selecting the SVM model. There have been a plethora of methods proposed to effectively deal with these two problems treated independently, however to the best of our knowledge, it was not explored how to effectively combine these two processes. It is a noteworthy observation that depending on the subset selected for training, a different SVM model may be optimal, hence performing these two operations simultaneously is potentially beneficial. In this paper, we propose a new method to select both the training set and the SVM model, using a genetic algorithm which alternately optimizes two different populations. We demonstrate that our approach is competitive with sequential optimization of the hyperparameters followed by selecting the training set. We report the results obtained for several benchmark data sets and we visualize the results elaborated for artificial sets of 2D points.",

abstract="The eye movement analysis undertaken in many research is conducted to better understand the biology of the brain and oculomotor system functioning. The studies presented in this paper considered eye movement signal as an output of a nonlinear dynamic system and are concentrated on determining the chaotic behaviour existence. The system nature was examined during a fixation, one of key components of eye movement signal, taking its vertical velocity into account. The results were compared with those obtained in the case of the horizontal direction. This comparison showed that both variables provide the similar representation of the underlying dynamics. In both cases, the analysis revealed the chaotic nature of eye movement for the first 200 ms, just after a stimulus position change. Subsequently, the signal characteristic tended to be the convergent one, however, in some cases, depending on a part of the fixation duration the chaotic behaviour was still observable.",

The PDPTW is a hierarchical objective problem---the main objective is to minimize the number of trucks serving the transportation requests, whereas the second objective is to optimize the travel distance. In our approach, the fleet size is optimized using the parallel ejection search, and the distance is minimized using the parallel memetic algorithm.

abstract = "Osteoporosis is a frequent bone disease without typical early symptoms but with serious complications e.g. low-energy bone fractures. Patients with risk factors should be screened for proper diagnosis as early as possible. Unfortunately, the registered medical data are often highly imbalanced. That is why the machine-based data processing is difficult or even impossible. Considering this, our goal was to search for the best method of coping with the problem of imbalancing in relation to the analysed data regarding the osteoporotic patients. Therefore, we checked several paradigms of classifiers in synergy with preprocessing techniques to address the inner skewed class distribution of the data. In the source dataset 92.6% of instances related to patients without any fractures (negative cases) and only 7.41% to patients (positive cases) who reported at least one fracture. To alleviate class imbalance there were examined not only data-level methods which in fact modify the input dataset, but also ensemble ones that strengthen the results of the base algorithms. In the first group the under- and over-sampling methods were used, such as random undersampling, edited nearest neighbours and synthetic minority over-sampling techniques, while in the second one – a range of methods based on various subsets of training data were analysed. Also various combinations of the above mentioned were investigated. Additionally, we propose the way how to find the balancing level which, without excessive distortion of the input, raw data, will give the appropriate classification efficiency. The aim of our experiment was to identify which of an undersampling or an oversampling approach with reference to the simple and the ensemble-based classifiers allows to achieve the best results. The outcomes of the comparative studies concerning imbalancing problem with regard to our dataset showed that the highest efficiency was achieved while using the synthetic minority over-sampling technique and RandomForest classifier. As far as the optimal balancing level is concerned, we empirically determined that 300% oversampling with the synthetic minority over-sampling method combined with edited nearest neighbours undersampling allowed to gain the required precision of classification."

Moreover, this technique may be useful inter alia in education, psychological tests and medical diagnosis. Video-based oculography (VOG) is the most commonly utilized technique because it is non-intrusive, can be applied in users' natural environments and is relatively cheap as it uses only basic cameras. There are already well-established methods for eye detection using still images registered by a camera. However, to be usable in the estimation of gaze position, eye image features must be associated with the place where an observer is looking; this typically requires the evaluation of several parameters during a process called calibration. The parameters significantly influence the quality of the analysis of subsequently collected data, thus they should be adjusted to the eye tracker used, the user and the environment. The purpose of this study is to present various calibration techniques and introduce an open, extendable and ready-to-use software application that implements these techniques. This software implements several algorithms already described in the literature and introduces some novel techniques. It provides the opportunity to compare different methods including plug-in self-developed filters and optimization algorithms; it also allows for analysis of results."
