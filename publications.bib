  abstract = {<jats:p>Reducing the energy consumption of a data centre while maintaining
	the requirements of the compute resources is a challenging problem
	that requires intelligent system design. It even becomes more challenging
	when dealing with an operating data centre. To achieve that goal
	without compromising the working conditions of the compute resources,
	a temperature model is needed that estimates the temperature within
	the hot corridor of the cooling system based on the properties of
	the external weather conditions and internal conditions such as server
	energy consumption, and cooling system state. In this paper, we discuss
	the dataset creation process as well as the process of evaluating
	a model for forecasting the temperature in the warm corridor of the
	data centre. The proposed solution compares two new neural network
	architectures, namely Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE) and Time-Series
	Mixer (TSMixer) with classical methods such as Random Forest and
	XGBoost and AutoARIMA. The obtained results indicate that the lowest
	prediction error was achieved by the TiDE model allowing to achieve
	0.1270 of N-RMSE followed by the XGBoost model with 0.1275 of N-RMSE.
	The additional analysis indicates a limitation of the use of the
	XGBoost model which tends to underestimate temperature as it approaches
	higher values, which is particularly important in avoiding safety
	conditions violations of the compute units.</jats:p>},

	consist of 100k (Failure 1), 30k (Failure 2) and 30k (Failure 3)
	samples and eight attributes. Then a broad range of classifiers are
	evaluated including three ensemble models based on decision trees:
	Random Forest, Gradient-Boosted Trees, and Rotation Forest, as well
	as the kNN algorithm and a neural network. The analysis showed that
	neural networks achieved the highest prediction accuracy, enabling
	a prediction accuracy level of 89%. The kNN algorithm ranked second,
	and tree-based algorithms performed 4% worse than the neural network.
	Next, the attribute importance analysis revealed that leak flow,
	pressure output, pressure of the leak line, and oil temperature are
	the most important parameters for accurate predictions. Additionally,
	the research includes a sensitivity analysis of the best classifier
	to verify the impact of sensor measurements or other noise indicators

  abstract = {<jats:p>Renewable energy sources, such as wind turbines, have become
	much more prevalent in recent years, and thus a popular form of energy
	generation. This is in part due to the ‘Fit for 55’ EU initiative,
	and in part, to rising fossil fuel prices, as well as the perceived
	requirement for nations to have power independence, and due to the
	influence of renewable energy sources we can see a marked increase
	in large wind farms in particular. However, wind farms by their very
	nature are highly inconsistent regarding power generation and are
	weather-dependent, thus presenting several challenges for transmission
	system operators. One of the options to overcome these issues is
	a system being able to forecast the generated power in a wide-ranging
	period—ranging from 15 min up to 36 h, and with an adequate resolution.
	Such a system would better help manage the power grid and allow for
	greater utilization of the green energy produced. In this document,
	we present a process of development for such a system, along with
	a comparison of the various steps of the process, including data
	preparation, feature importance analysis, and the impact of various
	data sources on the forecast horizon. Lastly, we also compare multiple
	machine learning models and their influence on the system quality
	and execution time. Additionally, we propose an ensemble that concatenates
	predictions over the forecast horizon. The conducted experiments
	have been evaluated on seven wind farms located in Central Europe.
	Out of the experiments conducted, the most efficient solution with
	the lowest error rate and required computational resources has been
	obtained for random forest regression, and two independent models;
	one for the short-term horizon, and the other, for the mid- to long-term
	horizon, which was combined into one forecasting system.</jats:p>},

	feature of signals is their potential to be chaotic. This article
	concerns the issues of classification of real signals or synthetic

	works, datasets of synthetic signals were created based on well-known
	chaotic and non-chaotic dynamical systems. They were published and
	used to train classifiers. This paper extends the previous studies
	and proposes a method for obtaining/extracting signals to force classifiers
	to learn to detect chaos. The proposed method allows the generation
	of groups of signals with similar initial conditions. The property
	of chaotic dynamical systems was used here, which consists of the
	strong dependence of the signal courses on a small change in the
	initial conditions. This method is based on reconstructing multidimensional
	phase space and data clustering. An additional goal of the work is
	to create referential datasets with so-called refined signals using
	the described method and to make them publicly available. The usefulness
	of the new datasets was confirmed during a simple experiment with
	the usage of the LSTM neural network.},

  abstract = {Event detection is the most important element of eye movement analysis.
	Deep learning approaches have recently demonstrated superior performance
	across various fields, so researchers have also used them to identify
	eye movement events. In this study, a combination of two-dimensional
	convolutional neural networks (2D-CNN) and long short-term memory
	(LSTM) layers is proposed to simultaneously classify input data into
	fixations, saccades, post-saccadic oscillations (PSOs), and smooth
	pursuits (SPs). The first step involves calculating features (i.e.,
	velocity, acceleration, jerk, and direction) from positional points.
	Various combinations of these features have been used as input to
	the networks. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated
	across all feature combinations and compared to state-of-the-art
	feature sets. Combining velocity and direction with acceleration
	and/or jerk demonstrated significant performance improvement compared
	to other feature combinations. The results show that the proposed
	method, using a combination of velocity and direction with acceleration
	and/or jerk, improves PSO identification performance, which has been
	difficult to distinguish from short saccades, fixations, and SPs
	using classic algorithms. Finally, heuristic event measures were
	applied, and performance was compared across different feature combinations.
	The results indicate that the model combining velocity, acceleration,
	jerk, and direction achieved the highest accuracy and most closely
	matched the ground truth. It correctly classified 82% of fixations,
	90% of saccades, and 88% of smooth pursuits. However, the PSO detection
	rate was only 73%, highlighting the need for further research.},

	it introduces some subjective assumptions and is sometimes called
	a “manual” method. Therefore, there are many attempts to provide
	alternative ways to assess the dynamical signal as chaotic or deterministic.
	Some of them use deep learning methods. In this paper, we present
	a novel method of signal classification that is based on the assumption
	that it is easier to learn deterministic behavior than a chaotic
	one. We show that based on this assumption, it is possible to calculate
	the “amount of chaos” in the signal with the help of a simple LSTM
	(Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. The main advantage of this
	method is that—contrary to other deep learning-based methods—it does
	not require prior data to train the network as the results of the
	training process for a signal being classified are taken into account
	as the result of this evaluation. We confirm the method’s validity

	multiple people&amp;rsquo;s data. We utilized only low-quality images
	directly collected from a standard desktop webcam, so our method
	can be applied to any computer system equipped with such a camera
	without additional hardware requirements. First, we used the web
	camera to collect a dataset of face and eye images. Then, we tested
	different combinations of CNN parameters, including the learning
	and dropout rates. Our findings show that building a person-specific
	eye-tracking model produces better results with a selection of good
	hyperparameters when compared to universal models that are trained
	on multiple users-data. In particular, we achieved the best results
	for the left eye with 38.20 MAE (Mean Absolute Error) in pixels,
	the right eye with 36.01 MAE, both eyes combined with 51.18 MAE,
	and the whole face with 30.09 MAE, which is equivalent to approximately
	1.45 degrees for the left eye, 1.37 degrees for the right eye, 1.98
	degrees for both eyes combined, and 1.14 degrees for full-face images.},

	with hyperspectral pansharpening which benefits from a high-resolution

	to reconstruct a high-resolution panchromatic image which is subsequently
	used during pansharpening. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed
	pipeline for PRISMA imagery, whose hyperspectral cubes (30 m ground
	sampling distance) are associated with panchromatic images (5 m ground
	sampling distance). The latter are upsampled by a factor of 3× relying

	Each pixel is assigned a cost of a path connecting the boundary of
	a local processing window with its center. When the central pixel
	exhibits a high value of the path with lowest cost, it is identified
	as an impulse. To achieve this, we use a thresholding procedure for
	detecting corrupted pixels. Analyzing the distribution of minimum
	path costs, we employ the k-means technique to classify pixels into
	three distinct categories: those nearly undistorted, those corrupted
	by Gaussian noise, and those affected by impulsive noise. Subsequently,
	we employ the Laplace interpolation technique to restore the impulsive
	pixels — a fast and effective method yielding satisfactory denoising
	results. In the second step, we address the residual Gaussian noise
	using the Non-Local Means method, which selectively considers pixels
	from the local window that have not been flagged as impulsive. The
	experimental results confirm that our proposed hybrid method consistently
	yields superior outcomes compared to state-of-the-art denoising techniques.
	Moreover, its computational complexity remains low, rendering it

	to classify real-life data. At the same time, classifier ensembles
	composed of many light base models are known to achieve high classification

	The obtained ensembles allow for high classification performance

  abstract = {Cloud detection is a pivotal satellite image pre-processing step that
	can be performed on board a satellite to tag useful images. It can
	reduce the amount of data to downlink by pruning the cloudy areas,
	or to make a satellite more autonomous through data-driven acquisition
	re-scheduling. This study approaches this task with a no-new-Net
	(nnU-Net), an adaptive framework to perform meta-learning of a segmentation
	network over various datasets. Unfortunately, such models are commonly
	memory-inefficient due to their (very) large architectures which
	renders them infeasible to be deployed in hardware-constrained edge
	devices. To benefit from such automatically-elaborated models, nnU-Nets
	are compressed with knowledge distillation into much smaller U-Nets
	that can fit the target hardware. The experiments, performed over
	Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images, and over the images simulating the
	imagery expected on board a new mission (Φ-Sat-2), revealed that
	nnU-Nets deliver state-of-the-art performance without any manual
	design. The proposed approach was ranked within the top 7% best solutions
	(across 847 teams) in the On Cloud N: Cloud Cover Detection Challenge,
	where it reached the Jaccard index of 0.882 over more than 10 thousand
	unseen Sentinel-2 images (the winners obtained Jaccard of 0.897,
	the baseline U-Net with the residual network backbone: 0.817, and
	the classic Sentinel-2 image thresholding: 0.652). The experimental
	study showed that knowledge distillation enables to elaborate dramatically
	smaller (almost 280×) U-Nets while maintaining the segmentation capabilities
	of nnU-Nets. Such compact U-Nets offer fast inference, as segmenting
	a 19.4 × 19.4 km scene took approximately 12 s on the Intel Movidius

  abstract = {Super-resolution is aimed at enhancing image spatial resolution and
	it has been intensively explored for many years. The recent advancements,
	underpinned with deep learning, also include techniques developed
	specifically for hyper-spectral data. However, most of the emerging
	methods are validated in application-independent scenarios, which
	often rely on an unrealistic experimental setup - the reconstruction
	is performed from simulated low-resolution images (degraded from
	an original image) with the goal of inverting the degradation process
	and restoring the original image. This leads to over-optimistic assessment
	of super-resolution capabilities and limits their practical applications.
	In this paper, we demonstrate task-based validation for different
	types of hyperspectral PRISMA image super-resolution, including pan-sharpening,
	fusion of multispectral and hyperspectral data, as well as single-image
	super-resolution. The obtained results reported in the paper are
	encouraging and they help better understand the value of super-resolved
	PRISMA images.},

	and allow to retrieve usable streets from space in case of floods,
	provide vessel detection in coastal areas, identify and classify
	cloud in images and finally compress and reconstruct images on ground
	through the use of AI. Alongside with the 4 main applications others
	have been selected through the OrbitalAI challenge ended in September
	2023 and will be implemented before the integration of the spacecraft
	on the launch vehicle. To allow for a proper development of all the
	onboard applications a Φsat-2 image simulator have been developed

	the satellite will undergo a commissioning phase dedicated to the

	will enter in its nominal phase that will last at least 12 months.
	During this period the applications will be routinely used and continuously

  abstract = {The advent of machine learning (ML) has significantly advanced the
	recognition and translation of sign languages, bridging communication
	gaps for hearing-impaired communities. At the heart of these technologies
	is data labeling, crucial for training ML algorithms on a huge amount
	of consistently labeled data to achieve models that generalize well.
	The adoption of language-agnostic annotations is essential to connect
	different sign languages, as single-language databases often provide
	limited lexicon examples, insufficient for training robust ML algorithms.
	This study critically examines the Hamburg Sign Language Notation
	System (HamNoSys), which describes the signer’s initial position
	and body movements, in contrary to the meanings of glosses. Despite
	HamNoSys’s utility in standardizing transcriptions across various
	sign languages, our investigation uncovers inconsistencies within
	HamNoSys that may negatively impact the development of accurate and
	reliable ML models. By analyzing HamNoSys labels across five sign
	languages, we identified a lack of standardized annotation procedures
	and the complexities within HamNoSys that introduce biases and errors.
	Our findings underscore the urgent need for unified, standardized
	data annotation guidelines to enhance the accuracy and efficiency
	of sign language recognition technologies. This research highlights
	the importance of addressing annotation challenges and advocates
	for a comprehensive, diversified database to improve the generalization
	of ML models.},

  abstract = {Cloud detection is a pivotal satellite image pre-processing step that
	can be performed on board a satellite to tag useful images. It can
	reduce the amount of data to downlink by pruning the cloudy areas,
	or to make a satellite more autonomous through data-driven acquisition
	re-scheduling. This study approaches this task with a no-new-Net
	(nnU-Net), an adaptive framework to perform meta-learning of a segmentation
	network over various datasets. Unfortunately, such models are commonly
	memory-inefficient due to their (very) large architectures which
	renders them infeasible to be deployed in hardware-constrained edge
	devices. To benefit from such automatically-elaborated models, nnU-Nets
	are compressed with knowledge distillation into much smaller U-Nets
	that can fit the target hardware. The experiments, performed over
	Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images, and over the images simulating the
	imagery expected on board a new mission (Φ-Sat-2), revealed that
	nnU-Nets deliver state-of-the-art performance without any manual
	design. The proposed approach was ranked within the top 7% best solutions
	(across 847 teams) in the On Cloud N: Cloud Cover Detection Challenge,
	where it reached the Jaccard index of 0.882 over more than 10 thousand
	unseen Sentinel-2 images (the winners obtained Jaccard of 0.897,
	the baseline U-Net with the residual network backbone: 0.817, and
	the classic Sentinel-2 image thresholding: 0.652). The experimental
	study showed that knowledge distillation enables to elaborate dramatically
	smaller (almost 280×) U-Nets while maintaining the segmentation capabilities
	of nnU-Nets. Such compact U-Nets offer fast inference, as segmenting
	a 19.4 × 19.4 km scene took approximately 12 s on the Intel Movidius
	Myriad-2 processing unit.},

	of cancer cells to the brain from extracranial sites. Notably, metastatic
	brain tumors surpass primary brain tumors in prevalence by a significant
	factor, they exhibit an aggressive growth potential and have the
	capacity to spread across diverse cerebral locations simultaneously.
	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of individuals afflicted with
	metastatic brain tumors unveil a wide spectrum of characteristics.
	These lesions vary in size and quantity, spanning from tiny nodules
	to substantial masses captured within MRI. Patients may present with
	a limited number of lesions or an extensive burden of hundreds of

	cavities, as well as areas of necrosis or edema. Thus, the manual

	and propose a pipeline for detecting and analyzing brain metastases
	in longitudinal studies, which benefits from an ensemble of various

	In this article, we tackle this task and introduce a genetic programming
	algorithm (called GIRAFFE) to build (deep) machine learning classification
	ensembles for arrhythmia classification from two-dimensional images
	of 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) tracings. GIRAFFE evolves the
	architecture, content, and fusion scheme of the ensemble, to obtain
	an accurate yet lightweight classification system. The experimental
	study performed over a large-scale dataset of ECG images revealed
	that our approach outperforms other ensemble methods and carefully
	fine-tuned deep models, elaborates compact heterogeneous ensembles,
	and does not require any user intervention hence it is easy to apply
	to other classification tasks.},

  abstract = {Glioblastoma is the most common form of brain cancer in adults, and
	is characterized by one of the worst
	
	prognosis, with median survival being less than one year. Magnetic
	resonance imaging (MRI) plays a key
	
	role in detecting and objectively tracking the disease by extracting
	quantifiable parameters of the tumor, such
	
	as its volume or bidimensional measurements. However, it has been
	shown that the presence a specific genetic
	
	sequence in a lesion, being the DNA repair enzyme O6 -methylguanine-DNA
	methyltransferase (MGMT)
	
	promoter methylation, may be effectively used to predict the patient’s
	responsiveness to chemotherapy. The
	
	invasive process of analyzing a tissue sample to verify the MGMT promoter
	methylation status is time-
	
	consuming, and may require performing multiple surgical interventions
	in longitudinal studies. Thus, building
	
	non-invasive techniques of predicting the genetic subtype of glioblastoma
	is of utmost practical importance
	
	to not only accelerate the overall process of determining the MGMT
	promoter methylation status in
	
	glioblastoma patients, but also to minimize the number of necessary
	surgeries. In this paper, we tackle this
	
	problem and propose an end-to-end machine learning classification
	pipeline benefitting from radiomic
	
	features extracted from brain MRI scans, and validate it over a well-established

  abstract = {Detecting anomalies in satellite telemetry data is pivotal in ensuring
	its safe operations. Although there exist various data-driven techniques
	for determining abnormal parts of the signal, they are virtually
	never validated over real telemetries. Analyzing such data is challenging
	due to its intrinsic characteristics, as telemetry may be noisy and
	affected by incorrect acquisition, e.g., rendering missing parts
	of the signal. Although there exist data-driven algorithms for detecting
	abnormal events, spanning across classic techniques exploiting expert
	systems, unsupervised approaches and deep learning models, they are
	virtually never validated over real-life telemetry data. Also, they
	often require long time-series data to build a model reflecting the
	nominal operation of the satellite – capturing it on board is tedious
	and time-consuming, thus data-level digital twins have been blooming
	to simulate the correct telemetry. Benchmark datasets commonly exploited
	to validate detection algorithms contain time-series data, where
	each time series is split into its training and test parts, presenting
	similar characteristics. Such data is not affected by the practical
	challenges commonly observed in on-board telemetry, such as data
	noisiness or missing data, due to e.g., inappropriate signal acquisition.
	Therefore, the estimated anomaly detection capabilities of data-driven
	techniques may easily become over-optimistic, and the experimental
	scenarios are often flawed by methodological issues in the field.
	In this paper, we present our approach toward building a supervised
	machine learning model for detecting anomalies in real-life OPS-SAT
	telemetry data. We will discuss our procedure for building a labeled
	dataset of telemetry examples from a large dataset of unlabeled telemetry,
	and will present the importance of following a rigorous procedure
	for this task, as the quality of the ground-truth annotations (elaborated
	by a data scientist, with and without the label validation performed
	by the OPS-SAT Operations Team) affects not only the training process,
	but also the final validation of the machine learning model. We will
	thoroughly discuss our quantitative and qualitative experimental
	analysis that allowed us to objectively quantify the detection capabilities
	of the models, benefiting from hand-crafted feature extractors and
	classic supervised learners, even for (extremely limited) ground
	truth data. Finally, we will discuss the approach that we followed
	to prepare a resulting machine learning model for deploying it on-board

	a data-producer pipeline, where the satellite is an individual
	
	source of information. It responses to an event, generates the
	
	data and transmits it to Earth-based ground stations.
	
	Constellations or trail formations often consist of several of
	
	these orbiters, operating separately or in a specific order, to
	
	provide desired data to operators. This data-producer pipeline
	
	has many shortcomings and bottlenecks – primarily it is

	overcome by deploying Space-based Data Centres (SDCs).
	
	SDCs provide on-demand in-orbit computing, storage, and

  abstract = {The nature of activity in the agricultural sector has changed over
	the years due to the growth of the population and the increase in
	its demand for food, fiber and fuel. The limited availability of
	agricultural land requires targeted management of resource production
	and leads to the increasing adoption of precision agriculture approaches.
	This requires the assessment of soil quality, its hydration, fertilizer
	content, and the impact of seasonality of ecosystems, which translate
	into crop yields. Satellite imaging brings enormous scalability in
	this context, if a satellite captured multi- or hyperspectral imagery
	(MSI and HSI) that allows us to perform non-invasive in-orbit soil
	analysis. This helps also reduce the amount of data to transfer back
	to Earth – instead of sending large-size HSI, we can transmit the
	extracted soil parameters only. Precise detection of the agricultural
	area corresponding to the soil in such imagery is important due to
	the possibility of reducing the amount of data for further processing,
	to extract various soil parameters, such as potassium, phosphorus
	pentoxide, magnesium or pH. The detection of the bare soil areas
	in the MSI and HSI data can be based on the investigation of various
	vegetation indices (which can later be used to estimate soil parameters
	or crop yields as well). The use of a multitude of available bands
	enables soil detection using sensors with different spectral ranges.
	However, such bands may not be available in real sensors that will
	fly on-board a satellite. In this paper, we present our approach
	toward building an algorithm for bare soil detection from HSI which
	will be captured on-board Intuition-1 – a satellite mission designed
	to observe the Earth using a hyperspectral instrument and an on-board
	computing unit capable of processing data using artificial intelligence.
	We will discuss our approach toward simulating on-board acquisition
	conditions that we expect to meet once the satellite is in orbit
	– we exploit data-level digital twins to transform airborne HSI into
	such imagery (here, we can simulate e.g., different atmospheric conditions).
	Finally, we will present our quantitative and qualitative approach
	(the latter including various visualizations of airborne and simulated
	imagery, alongside the extracted maps of spectral indices) toward
	assessing the capabilities of the bare soil detection algorithms
	in the case of very limited ground truth data. It is of note that
	the algorithms must be resource-frugal, and should be possible to
	run in a hardware-constrained execution environment.},

  abstract = {Hepatic cirrhosis is an increasing cause of mortality in developed
	countries—it is the pathological sequela of chronic liver diseases,
	and the final liver fibrosis stage. Since cirrhosis evolves from
	the asymptomatic phase, it is of paramount importance to detect it
	as quickly as possible, because entering the symptomatic phase commonly
	leads to hospitalization and can be fatal. Understanding the state
	of the liver based on the abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans
	is tedious, user-dependent and lacks reproducibility. We tackle these
	issues and propose an end-to-end and reproducible approach for detecting
	cirrhosis from CT. It benefits from the introduced clinically-inspired
	features that reflect the patient’s characteristics which are often
	investigated by experienced radiologists during the screening process.
	Such features are coupled with the radiomic ones extracted from the
	liver, and from the suggested region of interest which captures the
	liver’s boundary. The rigorous experiments, performed over two heterogeneous
	clinical datasets (two cohorts of 241 and 32 patients) revealed that
	extracting radiomic features from the liver’s rectified contour is
	pivotal to enhance the classification abilities of the supervised
	learners. Also, capturing clinically-inspired image features significantly
	improved the performance of such models, and the proposed features
	were consistently selected as the important ones. Finally, we showed
	that selecting the most discriminative features leads to the Pareto-optimal
	models with enhanced feature-level interpretability, as the number
	of features was dramatically reduced (280×) from thousands to tens.},

	                <jats:p>Diabetes mellitus (DM), heart failure (HF)
	and metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)
	are overlapping diseases of increasing prevalence. Because there
	are still high numbers of patients with HF who are undiagnosed and
	untreated, there is a need for improving efforts to better identify
	HF in patients with DM with or without MASLD. This study aims to
	develop machine learning (ML) models for assessing the risk of the
	HF occurrence in patients with DM with and without MASLD.</jats:p>

	                <jats:p>In the Silesia Diabetes-Heart Project (NCT05626413),
	patients with DM with and without MASLD were analyzed to identify
	the most important HF risk factors with the use of a ML approach.
	The multiple logistic regression (MLR) classifier exploiting the
	most discriminative patient’s parameters selected by the χ2 test
	following the Monte Carlo strategy was implemented. The classification
	capabilities of the ML models were quantified using sensitivity,
	specificity, and the percentage of correctly classified (CC) high-

	                <jats:p>We studied 2000 patients with DM (mean age
	58.85 ± SD 17.37 years; 48% women). In the feature selection process,
	we identified 5 parameters: age, type of DM, atrial fibrillation
	(AF), hyperuricemia and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
	In the case of MASLD( +) patients, the same criterion was met by
	3 features: AF, hyperuricemia and eGFR, and for MASLD(−) patients,
	by 2 features: age and eGFR. Amongst all patients, sensitivity and
	specificity were 0.81 and 0.70, respectively, with the area under

  abstract = {Tumor burden assessment by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is central
	to the evaluation of treatment response for glioblastoma. This assessment
	is, however, complex to perform and associated with high variability
	due to the high heterogeneity and complexity of the disease. In this
	work, we tackle this issue and propose a deep learning pipeline for
	the fully automated end-to-end analysis of glioblastoma patients.
	Our approach simultaneously identifies tumor sub-regions, including
	the enhancing tumor, peritumoral edema and surgical cavity in the
	first step, and then calculates the volumetric and bidimensional
	measurements that follow the current Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology
	(RANO) criteria. Also, we introduce a rigorous manual annotation
	process which was followed to delineate the tumor sub-regions by
	the human experts, and to capture their segmentation confidences
	that are later used while training deep learning models. The results
	of our extensive experimental study performed over 760 pre-operative
	and 504 post-operative adult patients with glioma obtained from the
	public database (acquired at 19 sites in years 2021–2020) and from
	a clinical treatment trial (47 and 69 sites for pre-/post-operative
	patients, 2009–2011) and backed up with thorough quantitative, qualitative
	and statistical analysis revealed that our pipeline performs accurate
	segmentation of pre- and post-operative MRIs in a fraction of the
	manual delineation time (up to 20 times faster than humans). Volumetric
	measurements were in strong agreement with experts with the Intraclass
	Correlation Coefficient (ICC): 0.959, 0.703, 0.960 for ET, ED, and
	cavity. Similarly, automated RANO compared favorably with experienced
	readers (ICC: 0.681 and 0.866) producing consistent and accurate
	results. Additionally, we showed that RANO measurements are not always
	sufficient to quantify tumor burden. The high performance of the
	automated tumor burden measurement highlights the potential of the
	tool for considerably improving and simplifying radiological evaluation
	of glioblastoma in clinical trials and clinical practice.},

	The tool was designed and evaluated in cooperation with domain experts
	from Airbus and ESA. Finally, we provide an extensive description

	data, however spatial resolution of their spectral bands limited

	in many cases. This problem can be addressed with super-resolution,
	aimed at reconstructing a high-resolution image from a low-resolution
	observation. For Sentinel-2, spectral information fusion allows for
	enhancing the 20 m and 60 m bands to the 10 m resolution. Also, there
	were attempts to combine multitemporal stacks of individual Sentinel-2
	bands, however these two approaches have not been combined so far.
	In this paper, we introduce DeepSent - a new deep network for super-resolving
	multitemporal series of multispectral Sentinel-2 images. It is underpinned
	with information fusion performed simultaneously in the spectral
	and temporal dimensions to generate an enlarged multispectral image.
	In our extensive experimental study, we demonstrate that our solution
	outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques that realize either
	multitemporal or multispectral data fusion. Furthermore, we show
	that the advantage of DeepSent results from how these two fusion
	types are combined in a single architecture, which is superior to
	performing such fusion in a sequential manner. Importantly, we have
	applied our method to super-resolve real-world Sentinel-2 images,
	enhancing the spatial resolution of all the spectral bands to 3.3
	m nominal ground sampling distance, and we compare the outcome with
	very high-resolution WorldView-2 images. We will publish our implementation
	upon paper acceptance, and we expect it will increase the possibilities

	Conventional methods of diagnosing plant diseases are based on visual

	conducted in laboratory settings by qualified personnel. Therefore,

	paper, and an approach for classifying selected Solanum lycopersicum
	diseases (anthracnose, bacterial speck, early blight, late blight
	and septoria leaf) from hyperspectral data captured on consecutive
	days post inoculation (DPI) is presented. The objective of that approach
	was to develop a technique for detecting infection in less than seven
	days after inoculation. The dataset used in this study included hyperspectral
	measurements of plants of two cultivars of S. lycopersicum: Benito
	and Polfast, which were infected with five different pathogens. Hyperspectral
	reflectance measurements were performed using a high-spectral-resolution
	field spectroradiometer (350-2500 nm range) and they were acquired
	for 63 days after inoculation, with particular emphasis put on the
	first 17 day-by-day measurements. Due to a significant data imbalance

	underpinned with deep learning, also include techniques developed

	methods are validated in application-independent scenarios, which

	is performed from simulated low-resolution images (degraded from
	an original image) with the goal of inverting the degradation process
	and restoring the original image. This leads to over-optimistic assessment
	of super-resolution capabilities and limits their practical applications.
	In this paper, we demonstrate task-based validation for different
	types of hyperspectral PRISMA image super-resolution, including pan-sharpening,
	fusion of multispectral and hyperspectral data, as well as single-image

	can detect how much the available features support recognition of

	is imbalance of classes, as learning from the data with this characteristic
	makes detection of existing patterns for all classes more difficult.
	However, other problems related to imbalance also exists and the
	paper addresses such cases where classes are balanced, but there
	is in-class imbalance. Such imbalance can be caused by uneven representation
	of sub-concepts. When there is a noticeable difference between the
	numbers of samples belonging to sub-concepts, this can turn the under-represented
	sub-concepts into disjuncts. Data irregularities of this type can
	hinder recognition, therefore actions are typically taken to restore
	balance. In the investigations described, the issue was studied in
	the stylometric domain and various classifiers were applied to the
	data that was balanced, then imbalanced, and finally with restored
	balance. The experiments show that the specifics of the domain of
	application can put its own mark on the data which is difficult to
	overcome by standard processing such as under- or oversampling. Observed

	Methods. The study sample comprises a group of 457 postmenopausal
	women aged over 55 years, recruited from the database of an outpatient
	osteoporotic clinic. Several variables with potential influence on
	bone status, including the measurement of body height and hip bone

	established using a Prodigy device (Lunar, GE, USA). Current body
	height was compared with the maximal historical body height in early
	adulthood, as reported by the patient. Results. Three hundred and
	ninety-four women did not have fractures during the follow up, and
	63 subjects presented fractures. Subjects with fracture had lower
	FN BMD with a T-score of −1.86 ± 1.04 compared to −1.44 ± 0.89 in
	those without fractures (p < 0.001). Mean height loss (HL) was 3.47
	± 2.11 cm in fractured subjects and 2.50 ± 2.47 cm in unfractured
	ones, and differed significantly, p < 0.01. Fracture incidence was
	significantly related to age, rheumatoid arthritis, falls, and previous
	fractures. In the multivariable analysis using logistic regression,
	FN BMD, baseline fracture, and HL were identified as the significant
	predictors of fractures of follow up. Conclusions. Osteoporotic fractures
	in postmenopausal women were predicted by FN BMD, prior fracture(s),
	and HL easily established during physical examination.},

  abstract = {Survival analysis is widely used in fields such as medical research
	and reliability engineering to analyze data where not all subjects
	experience the event of interest by the end of the study. It requires
	dedicated methods capable of handling censored cases. This paper
	extends the collection of techniques applicable to censored data
	by introducing a novel algorithm for interpretable recommendations
	based on a set of survival action rules. Each action rule contains
	recommendations for changing the values of attributes describing
	examples. As a result of applying the action rules, an example is
	moved from a group characterized by a survival curve to another group
	with a significantly different survival rate. In practice, an example
	can be covered by several induced rules. To decide which attribute
	values should be changed, we propose a recommendation algorithm that
	analyzes all actions suggested by the rules covering the example.
	The efficiency of the algorithm has been evaluated on several benchmark
	datasets. We also present a qualitative analysis of the generated
	recommendations through a case study. The results indicate that the
	proposed method produces high-quality recommendations and leads to
	a significant change in the estimated survival time.},

	limits their ability to discover complex dependencies that may exist
	in data. This article presents an extension to the sequential covering
	rule induction algorithm that allows it to generate complex and M-of-N
	conditions within the premises of rules. The proposed methodology
	uncovers complex patterns in data that are not adequately expressed
	by rules with simple conditions. The novel two-phase approach efficiently
	generates M-of-N conditions by analysing frequent sets in previously
	induced simple and complex rule conditions. The presented method
	allows rule induction for classification, regression and survival
	problems. Extensive experiments on various public datasets show that
	the proposed method often leads to more concise rulesets compared
	to those using only simple conditions. Importantly, the inclusion
	of complex conditions and M-of-N conditions has no statistically
	significant negative impact on the predictive ability of the ruleset.
	Experimental results and a ready-to-use implementation are available
	in the GitHub repository. The proposed algorithm can potentially
	serve as a valuable tool for knowledge discovery and facilitate the
	interpretation of rule-based models by making them more concise.},

	to create understandable prediction models
	
	that are presented as a set of rules. Because of their interpretability,
	they can be used and understood by a wide
	
	range of users – from data science experts to professionals in other
	fields who want to analyse their data. For
	
	this reason, it is beneficial to offer systems for rule induction
	with a graphical user interface (GUI) that would be
	
	usable also for users without programming skills. This article proposes
	a RuleMiner – a new web service for rule
	
	induction and rule-based data analysis. RuleMiner application is a
	development of the original RuleKit library
	
	co-developed by the authors. The platform allows users to run RuleKit
	algorithms for classification, regression,
	
	and survival rules at the GUI level without requiring programming
	knowledge. It also offers the functionalities
	
	to work with sets of rules and datasets, visualise the results, perform
	user-driven rule induction, analyse the
	
	created models, explore the coverage of individual rules and examples,
	analyse models’ predictive capabilities,
	
	and perform predictions for new examples. The RuleMiner platform is
	publicly available. The article presents
	
	the related work, shows RuleKit comparison with selected algorithms,
	highlights the most important RuleMiner

	algorithm but generates rules defining the actions required to change
	not the class but the survival curve of the covered examples. Thus,
	this study poses a new research problem: generating action rules
	for censored data and survival analysis. This study evaluated the
	proposed method using 22 data sets in which two application domains
	of survival analysis were distinguished: medicine and predictive
	maintenance. In addition, more detailed analyses of the generated
	survival action rules were presented in the form of case studies
	for the two selected data sets. The results show that the proposed
	method generates good-quality survival action rules and changes in
	the survival curves, resulting from the identified actions are significant.},

ABSTRACT = {Instance selection and construction methods were originally designed to improve the performance of the k-nearest neighbors classifier by increasing its speed and improving the classification accuracy. These goals were achieved by eliminating redundant and noisy samples, thus reducing the size of the training set. In this paper, the performance of instance selection methods is investigated in terms of classification accuracy and reduction of training set size. The classification accuracy of the following classifiers is evaluated: decision trees, random forest, Naive Bayes, linear model, support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors. The obtained results indicate that for the most of the classifiers compressing the training set affects prediction performance and only a small group of instance selection methods can be recommended as a general purpose preprocessing step. These are learning vector quantization based algorithms, along with the Drop2 and Drop3. Other methods are less efficient or provide low compression ratio.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of a zonal structure for energy markets across the globe is expanding; however the debate on how to effectively partition the grid into bidding zones is still open for discussion. One of the factors that needs to be addressed in the process of bidding zones’ delimitation is the transmission system operators control areas. Merging parts of different control areas into one bidding zone can lead to multiple problems, ranging from political, through grid security concerns, to reserve control issues. To address it, this paper presents a novel grid partitioning method aimed at bidding zones delimitation that is based on clustering the power grid using an extended version of the standard agglomerative clustering. The proposed solution adds additional clustering rules when constructing the dendrogram in order to take into account the control areas. The algorithm is applied to the data which represents the locational marginal prices obtained from optimal power flow analysis.},

abstract = {Data selection, which includes feature and instance selection, is often an important step in building prediction systems. Genetic algorithms (GA) frequently allow finding better solutions than classical methods in many areas. This is also true for the instance selection task. The main difficulties and challenges in GA-based instance selection are high computational complexity and decreasing performance with the dataset size growth. This is caused by the fact that each instance is encoded in one chromosome position. Hence bigger datasets result in longer chromosomes. The main contribution of this paper addresses the above problems in a three-step process. In the first step the dataset is divided into several consistent regions by fuzzy clustering. Then GA-based instance selection is performed independently within each cluster. Finally ensemble voting provides seamless aggregation of the partial results from the overlapping clusters. This improves dataset exploitation by more localized search and also takes the advantage of ensemble methods. This method significantly improves the predictive model performance and data reduction in comparison to instance selection performed on the whole training dataset.}

In this paper, we introduce the recurrent neural networks equipped with attention modules that quantify the importance of features, hence can be employed to select only an informative subset of all available features. Additionally, our models are trained in an end-to-end fashion, hence are directly applicable to infer over the unseen data. Our experiments included datasets from various domains and showed that the proposed technique is data-driven, easily applicable to new use cases, and competitive to other dimensionality reduction algorithms.",

First, we detect tumors in a binary-classification setting, and they later undergo multi-class segmentation. To provide high-quality generalization, we investigate several regularization techniques that help improve the segmentation performance obtained for the unseen scans, and benefit from the expert knowledge of a senior radiologist captured in a form of several post-processing routines. Our preliminary experiments elaborated over the BraTS'20 validation set revealed that our approach delivers high-quality tumor delineation.",

abstract = {Active collision avoidance has become an important task in space operations nowadays, and hundreds of alerts corresponding to close encounters of a satellite and other space objects are typically issued for a satellite in Low Earth Orbit every week. Such alerts are provided in the form of conjunction data messages, and only about two actionable alerts per spacecraft and week remain to be resolved after analyzing all cases. Therefore, building fully automated techniques for predicting the collision risk can help make the process of avoiding collisions less costly, as the number of false positives could be substantially reduced. In this paper, we present our machine learning techniques for this task which we exploited in the Collision Avoidance Challenge organized by the European Space Agency, in which we took the seventh place as the DunderMifflin Team (out of 97 registered participants).}

abstract="Capturing, transferring, and storing high-resolution images has become a serious issue in a wide range of fields, in which these processes are costly, time-consuming, or even infeasible. As obtaining low-resolution images may be easier in practice, enhancing their spatial resolution is currently an active research area and encompasses both single- and multiple-image super-resolution techniques. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach for multiple-image super-resolution that is independent from the number of available low-resolution images of the scene. It is in contrast to other deep networks which are crafted to deal with input stacks of a constant size, hence are not applicable once the number of low-resolution images varies. The experiments showed that our technique not only outperforms other single- and multiple-image super-resolution algorithms, but also it is lightweight and delivers instant operation, thus can be deployed in hardware-constrained environments.",

abstract = {Support vector machines (SVMs) have been exploited in a plethora of real-life classification and regression tasks, and are one of the most researched supervised learners. However, their generalization abilities strongly depend on the pivotal hyperparameters of the classifier, alongside its training dataset. Also, the training process is computationally and memory expensive, hence learning multiple SVMs to grid-search the hyperparameter space is infeasible in practice. In this paper, we address the problem of optimizing SVMs for binary classification of difficult datasets, including very large and extremely imbalanced cases. We propose an evolutionary technique that simultaneously optimizes the critical SVM aspects, including the training sample, kernel functions, and features. Also, we introduce a co-evolutionary scheme that allows us to guide the search in a competitive way to the highest-quality solutions. Our extensive experimental study performed over more than 120 benchmarks showed that the proposed algorithm outperforms popular supervised learners, as well as other techniques for optimizing SVMs reported in the literature.}

Although there have been many works published addressing this problem and a couple of excellent benchmark databases created, the existing state-of-the-art approaches do not exploit the action units defined within the Facial Action Coding System that has become a standard in facial expression analysis. In this work, we explore the possibilities of extracting discriminative features directly from the dynamics of facial action units to differentiate between genuine and posed smiles. We report the results of our experimental study which shows that the proposed features offer competitive performance to those based on facial landmark analysis and on textural descriptors extracted from spatial-temporal blocks. We make these features publicly available for the UvA-NEMO and BBC databases, which will allow other researchers to further improve the classification scores, while preserving the interpretation capabilities attributed to the use of facial action units. Moreover, we have developed a new technique for identifying the smile phases, which is robust against the noise and allows for continuous analysis of facial videos.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the problem of the identification of undesirable events is discussed. Such events can be poorly represented in the historical data, and it is predominantly impossible to learn from past examples. The discussed issue is considered in the work in the context of two use cases in which vibration and temperature measurements collected by wireless sensors are analysed. These use cases include crushers at a coal-fired power plant and gantries in a steelworks converter. The awareness, resulting from the cooperation with industry, of the need for a system that works in cold start conditions and does not flood the machine operator with alarms was the motivation for proposing a new predictive maintenance method. The proposed solution is based on the methods of outlier identification. These methods are applied to the collected data that was transformed into a multidimensional feature vector. The novelty of the proposed solution stems from the creation of a methodology for the reduction of false positive alarms, which was applied to a system identifying undesirable events. This methodology is based on the adaptation of the system to the analysed data, the interaction with the dispatcher, and the use of the XAI (eXplainable Artificial Intelligence) method. The experiments performed on several data sets showed that the proposed method reduced false alarms by 90.25% on average in relation to the performance of the stand-alone outlier detection method. The obtained results allowed for the implementation of the developed method to a system operating in a real industrial facility. The conducted research may be valuable for systems with a cold start problem where frequent alarms can lead to discouragement and disregard for the system by the user.},

In this paper, we propose a fully-automated, end-to-end system for DCE-MRI analysis of brain tumors. Our deep learning-powered technique does not require any user interaction, it yields reproducible results, and it is rigorously validated against benchmark and clinical data. Also, we introduce a cubic model of the vascular input function used for pharmacokinetic modeling which significantly decreases the fitting error when compared with the state of the art, alongside a real-time algorithm for determination of the vascular input region. An extensive experimental study, backed up with statistical tests, showed that our system delivers state-of-the-art results while requiring less than 3 min to process an entire input DCE-MRI study using a single GPU."

We present statistics and methodological approaches that measure low complexity (LC) and related sequence properties. Composition bias is often associated with LC and disorder, but repeats, while compositionally biased, might also induce ordered structures. We illustrate this dichotomy, and more generally the overlaps between different properties related to LCRs, using examples. We argue that statistical measures alone cannot capture all structural aspects of LCRs and recommend the combined usage of a variety of predictive tools and measurements. While the methodologies available to study LCRs are already very advanced, we foresee that a more comprehensive annotation of sequences in the databases will enable the improvement of predictions and a better understanding of the evolution and the connection between structure and function of LCRs. This will require the use of standards for the generation and exchange of data describing all aspects of LCRs.There are multiple definitions for low complexity regions (LCRs) in protein sequences.

It means that conclusions and observations are based on reduced data, as usually by discretisation some information is discarded. The paper presents a different approach, with taking advantage of discretisation executed after data mining. In the described study firstly decision rules were induced from real-valued features. Secondly, data sets were discretised. Using categories found for attributes, in the third step conditions included in inferred rules were translated into discrete domain. The properties and performance of rule classifiers were tested in the domain of stylometric analysis of texts, where writing styles were defined through quantitative attributes of continuous nature. The performed experiments show that the proposed processing leads to sets of rules with significantly reduced sizes while maintaining quality of predictions, and allows to test many data discretisation methods at the acceptable computational costs.},

Calculation of the methane hazard rate requires specialized equipment, which might be not fully available at the monitored place and consequently might require manual measurements by miners. The lack of measurements can be also caused by a device failure, thus hampering continuous evaluation of the methane rate. In this paper we address this problem by constructing a fuzzy system being able to calculate the methane hazard rate in a continuous manner and deal with data incompleteness. We examine the effectiveness of different fuzzy clustering algorithms in our system and compare the proposed system to other state-of-the-art methods. The extensive experiments show that the proposed method is characterized by superior accuracy when compared to other methods.",

We propose an induction algorithm which takes into account user’s requirements.

The over- and under-sampling methods help to tackle this issue, however they often have serious shortcomings. In this paper different methods of class balancing, especially those obtained by undersampling, are analyzed. Besides, a new solution is presented. The method is oriented toward finding and thinning clusters of majority class examples. Removing observations from high-density areas can lead to a less loss of information than in the case of removing individual examples or these from less-density areas. Such approach makes the distribution of examples more even. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through extensive comparisons to other undersampling methods with the use of eighteen public datasets. The results of experiments show that in many cases the proposed solution allows to achieve better performance than other tested techniques."

A data granule may be defined as a collection of related entities in sense of similarity, proximity, indiscernibility. Nowadays granular computing focuses on elaboration of granules from data. This step in granular computing is well researched. Our objective is the next step: we would like to focus on computing with granules. In the paper we propose a new clustering algorithm that works with granules instead of numbers. The algorithm takes a collection of granules as an input and clusters them into output granules.",

Despite the high prediction rate of this technique in a wide range of real applications, the efficiency of SVM and its classification performance highly depends on the hyperparameters setting as well as the selection of feature subset. Moreover, high memory and computational complexity of SVM training can be a limiting factor for its application on huge dataset. In this work we propose a novel memetic algorithm for support vector machine called SE-SVM to address mentioned problems. We use evolutionary techniques that optimize hyperparameters and select features and training set simultaneously. The algorithm is applied to seven datasets. All of that datasets are binary classification problem. We compare the SE-SVM to different evolutionary algorithms, random search techniques and other well-established classifiers. The experimental results show that the end result obtained by SE-SVM achieves high classification performance with a shorter training and classification time.",

	abstract = "Background and Objective
	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an indispensable tool in diagnosing brain-tumor patients. Automated tumor segmentation is being widely researched to accelerate the MRI analysis and allow clinicians to precisely plan treatment—accurate delineation of brain tumors is a critical step in assessing their volume, shape, boundaries, and other characteristics. However, it is still a very challenging task due to inherent MR data characteristics and high variability, e.g., in tumor sizes or shapes. We present a new deep learning approach for accurate brain tumor segmentation which can be trained from small and heterogeneous datasets annotated by a human reader (providing high-quality ground-truth segmentation is very costly in practice).
	Methods
	In this paper, we present a new deep learning technique for segmenting brain tumors from fluid attenuation inversion recovery MRI. Our technique exploits fully convolutional neural networks, and it is equipped with a battery of augmentation techniques that make the algorithm robust against low data quality, and heterogeneity of small training sets. We train our models using only positive (tumorous) examples, due to the limited amount of available data.
	Results
	Our algorithm was tested on a set of stage II-IV brain-tumor patients (image data collected using MAGNETOM Prisma 3T, Siemens). Rigorous experiments, backed up with statistical tests, revealed that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approach (utilizing hand-crafted features) in terms of segmentation accuracy, offers very fast training and instant segmentation (analysis of an image takes less than a second). Building our deep model is 1.3 times faster compared with extracting features for extremely randomized trees, and this training time can be controlled. Finally, we showed that too aggressive data augmentation may lead to deteriorated performance of the model, especially in the fixed-budget training (with maximum numbers of training epochs).
	Conclusions
	Our method yields the better performance when compared with the state of the art method which utilizes hand-crafted features. In addition, our deep network can be effectively applied to difficult (small, imbalanced, and heterogeneous) datasets, offers controllable training time, and infers in real-time."

This review provides an extensive survey on existing methods for selecting SVM training data from large datasets. We divide the state-of-the-art techniques into several categories.

	abstract="Super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) is aimed at increasing image spatial resolution from multiple images presenting the same scene or from a single image based on the learned relation between low and high resolution. Emergence of deep learning allowed for improving single-image SRR significantly in the last few years, and a variety of deep convolutional neural networks of different depth and complexity were proposed for this purpose. However, although there are usually some comparisons reported in the papers introducing new deep models for SRR, such experimental studies are somehow limited. First, the networks are often trained using different training data, and/or prepared in a different way. Second, the validation is performed for artificially-degraded images, which does not correspond to the real-world conditions. In this paper, we report the results of our extensive experimental study to compare several state-of-the-art SRR techniques which exploit deep neural networks. We train all the networks using the same training setup and validate them using several datasets of different nature, including real-life scenarios. This allows us to draw interesting conclusions that may be helpful for selecting the most appropriate deep architecture for a given SRR scenario, as well as for creating new SRR solutions.",

To address this need we developed a remotely accessible BioTest platform which allows to process multi-omics data, obtained using various measurement techniques, including next-generation sequencing (NGS), oligonucleotide microarrays, and mass spectrometry. This allows to process various biomedical data from genomic level, trough transcriptomics, up to the proteomic level on a scalable environment that can handle even the largest datasets. Integrated version control for library files and intermediate results as well as the possibility of designing workflows comprised of various algorithms, ensures that all of the results are highly reproducible.

We illustrate this dichotomy, and more generally the overlaps between different properties related to LCRs, using examples. We argue that statistical measures alone cannot capture all structural aspects of LCRs and recommend the combined usage of a variety of predictive tools and measurements. While the methodologies available to study LCRs are already very advanced, we foresee that a more comprehensive annotation of sequences in the databases will enable the improvement of predictions and a better understanding of the evolution and the connection between structure and function of LCRs.

		abstract = "{The widespread occurrence of repetitive stretches of DNA in genomes of organisms across the tree of life imposes fundamental challenges for sequencing, genome assembly, and automated annotation of genes and proteins. This multi-level problem can lead to errors in genome and protein databases that are often not recognized or acknowledged. As a consequence, end users working with sequences with repetitive regions are faced with ‘ready-to-use’ deposited data whose trustworthiness is difficult to determine, let alone to quantify. Here, we provide a review of the problems associated with tandem repeat sequences that originate from different stages during the sequencing-assembly-annotation-deposition workflow, and that may proliferate in public database repositories affecting all downstream analyses. As a case study, we provide examples of the Atlantic cod genome, whose sequencing and assembly were hindered by a particularly high prevalence of tandem repeats. We complement this case study with examples from other species, where mis-annotations and sequencing errors have propagated into protein databases. With this review, we aim to raise the awareness level within the community of database users, and alert scientists working in the underlying workflow of database creation that the data they omit or improperly assemble may well contain important biological information valuable to others.}",

		abstract="It is well known that discretisation of datasets in some cases may improve the quality of a decision system. Such effects were observed many times during experiments conducted in stylometry domain when authorship attribution tasks were performed. However, some experiments delivered results worse than expected when all attributes in datasets were discretised. Therefore, the idea to test decision systems where only part of attributes is discretised arose. For the selection of attributes to be discretised the greedy forward and backward sequential selection methods were proposed and deeply investigated. Different supervised and unsupervised discretisation methods were employed. The Naive Bayes classifier was selected as the inducer in the decision system. The relation between the subsequent subsets of attributes being discretised and the performance of the decision system was observed. The research proved that there is the maximum of the measure of system quality in respect to the series of subsets of attributes being discretised, generated during the sequential selection processes. Therefore, the attempts to find the optimal subsets of attributes to be discretised are reasonable.",

		abstract={Ranking is a strategy widely used for estimating relevance or importance of available characteristic features. Depending on the applied methodology, variables are assessed individually or as subsets, by some statistics referring to information theory, machine learning algorithms, or specialised procedures that execute systematic search through the feature space. The information about importance of attributes can be used in the pre-processing step of initial data preparation, to remove irrelevant or superfluous elements. It can also be employed in post-processing, for optimisation of already constructed classifiers. The chapter describes research on the latter approach, involving filtering inferred decision rules while exploiting ranking positions and scores of features. The optimised rule classifiers were applied in the domain of stylometric analysis of texts for the task of binary authorship attribution.},

		abstract={Super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) allows for producing a high-resolution (HR) image from a set of low-resolution (LR) observations. The majority of existing methods require tuning a number of hyper-parameters which control the reconstruction process and configure the imaging model that is supposed to reflect the relation between high and low resolution. In this paper, we demonstrate that the reconstruction process is very sensitive to the actual relation between LR and HR images, and we argue that this is a substantial obstacle in deploying SRR in practice. We propose to search the hyper-parameter space using a genetic algorithm (GA), thus adapting to the actual relation between LR and HR, which has not been reported in the literature so far. The results of our extensive experimental study clearly indicate that our GA improves the capacities of SRR. Importantly, the GA converges to different values of the hyper-parameters depending on the applied degradation procedure, which is confirmed using statistical tests.},

		abstract={Feature extraction is the first step in building real-life classification engines---it aims at elaborating features to characterize objects that are to be labeled by a trained model. Time-consuming feature extraction requires domain expertise to effectively design features. Deep neural networks (DNNs) appeared as a remedy in this context---their shallow layers perform representation learning, being an automated discovery of various-level features that robustly represent objects. However, the representations that are being learnt are still extremely difficult to interpret, and DNNs are prone to memorizing small datasets. In this paper, we introduce evolvable deep features (EDFs)---a DNN is used to extract automatic features that undergo genetic feature selection. Such evolved features are fed into a supervised learner. The experiments, backed up with statistical tests, performed on multi- and binary-class sets showed that our approach automatically learns object representations, greatly reduces the number of features without deteriorating the performance of trained models, and can even boost their classification performance.},

		abstract = {Most naturally-occurring physical phenomena are examples of nonlinear dynamic systems, the functioning of which attracts many researchers seeking to unveil their nature. The research presented in this paper is aimed at exploring eye movement dynamic features in terms of the existence of chaotic nature. Nonlinear time series analysis methods were used for this purpose. Two time series features were studied: fractal dimension and entropy, by utilising the embedding theory. The methods were applied to the data collected during the experiment with  jumping point  stimulus. Eye movements were registered by means of the Jazz-novo eye tracker. One thousand three hundred and ninety two (1392) time series were defined, based on the horizontal velocity of eye movements registered during imposed, prolonged fixations. In order to conduct detailed analysis of the signal and identify differences contributing to the observed patterns of behaviour in time scale, fractal dimension and entropy were evaluated in various time series intervals. The influence of the noise contained in the data and the impact of the utilized filter on the obtained results were also studied. The low pass filter was used for the purpose of noise reduction with a 50 Hz cut-off frequency, estimated by means of the Fourier transform and all concerned methods were applied to time series before and after noise reduction. These studies provided some premises, which allow perceiving eye movements as observed chaotic data: characteristic of a space-time separation plot, low and non-integer time series dimension, and the time series entropy characteristic for chaotic systems.},

Its main objective is to minimize the number of vehicles, and the secondary objective is to minimize the distance traveled during the service. In this paper, we propose the longest common subsequence based selective route exchange crossover (LCS-SREX), and apply this operator in the memetic algorithm (MA) for the PDPTW. Also, we suggest the new solution representation which helps handle the crossover efficiently. Extensive experimental study performed on the benchmark set showed that using LCS-SREX leads to very high-quality feasible solutions. The analysis is backed with the statistical tests to verify the importance of the elaborated results. Finally, we report one new world's best routing schedule found using a parallel version of the MA exploiting LCS-SREX.},

		abstract={Support vector machines (SVMs) have been found highly helpful in solving numerous pattern recognition tasks. Although it is challenging to train SVMs from large data sets, this obstacle may be mitigated by selecting a small, yet representative, subset of the entire training set. Another crucial and deeply-investigated problem consists in selecting the SVM model. There have been a plethora of methods proposed to effectively deal with these two problems treated independently, however to the best of our knowledge, it was not explored how to effectively combine these two processes. It is a noteworthy observation that depending on the subset selected for training, a different SVM model may be optimal, hence performing these two operations simultaneously is potentially beneficial. In this paper, we propose a new method to select both the training set and the SVM model, using a genetic algorithm which alternately optimizes two different populations. We demonstrate that our approach is competitive with sequential optimization of the hyperparameters followed by selecting the training set. We report the results obtained for several benchmark data sets and we visualize the results elaborated for artificial sets of 2D points.},

		abstract={The eye movement analysis undertaken in many research is conducted to better understand the biology of the brain and oculomotor system functioning. The studies presented in this paper considered eye movement signal as an output of a nonlinear dynamic system and are concentrated on determining the chaotic behaviour existence. The system nature was examined during a fixation, one of key components of eye movement signal, taking its vertical velocity into account. The results were compared with those obtained in the case of the horizontal direction. This comparison showed that both variables provide the similar representation of the underlying dynamics. In both cases, the analysis revealed the chaotic nature of eye movement for the first 200 ms, just after a stimulus position change. Subsequently, the signal characteristic tended to be the convergent one, however, in some cases, depending on a part of the fixation duration the chaotic behaviour was still observable.},

We analyze transcription profiles of human cell line K562 and we show that clustering allows grouping functionally related GO terms and therefore obtaining more concise and comprehensive description. By applying cluster-specific data aggregation tool we are able to calculate statistics for the individual clusters of GO terms and compare the number of differentially expressed genes between two sample pairs.

Also, we perform the qualitative analysis of the retrieved support vectors using an artificially generated dataset. Finally, we show how to optimize the SVM models using a genetic algorithm.

In this paper, we theoretically analyze the time complexity of our parallel algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (PDPTW), which is an NP-hard discrete optimization task. The PDPTW is a hierarchical objective problem---the main objective is to minimize the number of trucks serving the transportation requests, whereas the second objective is to optimize the travel distance. In our approach, the fleet size is optimized using the parallel ejection search, and the distance is minimized using the parallel memetic algorithm.

		abstract = {Osteoporosis is a frequent bone disease without typical early symptoms but with serious complications e.g. low-energy bone fractures. Patients with risk factors should be screened for proper diagnosis as early as possible. Unfortunately, the registered medical data are often highly imbalanced. That is why the machine-based data processing is difficult or even impossible. Considering this, our goal was to search for the best method of coping with the problem of imbalancing in relation to the analysed data regarding the osteoporotic patients. Therefore, we checked several paradigms of classifiers in synergy with preprocessing techniques to address the inner skewed class distribution of the data. In the source dataset 92.6% of instances related to patients without any fractures (negative cases) and only 7.41% to patients (positive cases) who reported at least one fracture. To alleviate class imbalance there were examined not only data-level methods which in fact modify the input dataset, but also ensemble ones that strengthen the results of the base algorithms. In the first group the under- and over-sampling methods were used, such as random undersampling, edited nearest neighbours and synthetic minority over-sampling techniques, while in the second one   a range of methods based on various subsets of training data were analysed. Also various combinations of the above mentioned were investigated. Additionally, we propose the way how to find the balancing level which, without excessive distortion of the input, raw data, will give the appropriate classification efficiency. The aim of our experiment was to identify which of an undersampling or an oversampling approach with reference to the simple and the ensemble-based classifiers allows to achieve the best results. The outcomes of the comparative studies concerning imbalancing problem with regard to our dataset showed that the highest efficiency was achieved while using the synthetic minority over-sampling technique and RandomForest classifier. As far as the optimal balancing level is concerned, we empirically determined that 300% oversampling with the synthetic minority over-sampling method combined with edited nearest neighbours undersampling allowed to gain the required precision of classification.}

Video-based oculography (VOG) is the most commonly utilized technique because it is non-intrusive, can be applied in users' natural environments and is relatively cheap as it uses only basic cameras. There are already well-established methods for eye detection using still images registered by a camera. However, to be usable in the estimation of gaze position, eye image features must be associated with the place where an observer is looking; this typically requires the evaluation of several parameters during a process called calibration. The parameters significantly influence the quality of the analysis of subsequently collected data, thus they should be adjusted to the eye tracker used, the user and the environment. The purpose of this study is to present various calibration techniques and introduce an open, extendable and ready-to-use software application that implements these techniques. This software implements several algorithms already described in the literature and introduces some novel techniques. It provides the opportunity to compare different methods including plug-in self-developed filters and optimization algorithms; it also allows for analysis of results.}
