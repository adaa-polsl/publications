ABSTRACT = {Instance selection and construction methods were originally designed to improve the performance of the k-nearest neighbors classifier by increasing its speed and improving the classification accuracy. These goals were achieved by eliminating redundant and noisy samples, thus reducing the size of the training set. In this paper, the performance of instance selection methods is investigated in terms of classification accuracy and reduction of training set size. The classification accuracy of the following classifiers is evaluated: decision trees, random forest, Naive Bayes, linear model, support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors. The obtained results indicate that for the most of the classifiers compressing the training set affects prediction performance and only a small group of instance selection methods can be recommended as a general purpose preprocessing step. These are learning vector quantization based algorithms, along with the Drop2 and Drop3. Other methods are less efficient or provide low compression ratio.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of a zonal structure for energy markets across the globe is expanding; however the debate on how to effectively partition the grid into bidding zones is still open for discussion. One of the factors that needs to be addressed in the process of bidding zones’ delimitation is the transmission system operators control areas. Merging parts of different control areas into one bidding zone can lead to multiple problems, ranging from political, through grid security concerns, to reserve control issues. To address it, this paper presents a novel grid partitioning method aimed at bidding zones delimitation that is based on clustering the power grid using an extended version of the standard agglomerative clustering. The proposed solution adds additional clustering rules when constructing the dendrogram in order to take into account the control areas. The algorithm is applied to the data which represents the locational marginal prices obtained from optimal power flow analysis.},

abstract = {Data selection, which includes feature and instance selection, is often an important step in building prediction systems. Genetic algorithms (GA) frequently allow finding better solutions than classical methods in many areas. This is also true for the instance selection task. The main difficulties and challenges in GA-based instance selection are high computational complexity and decreasing performance with the dataset size growth. This is caused by the fact that each instance is encoded in one chromosome position. Hence bigger datasets result in longer chromosomes. The main contribution of this paper addresses the above problems in a three-step process. In the first step the dataset is divided into several consistent regions by fuzzy clustering. Then GA-based instance selection is performed independently within each cluster. Finally ensemble voting provides seamless aggregation of the partial results from the overlapping clusters. This improves dataset exploitation by more localized search and also takes the advantage of ensemble methods. This method significantly improves the predictive model performance and data reduction in comparison to instance selection performed on the whole training dataset.}

Such alerts are provided in the form of conjunction data messages, and only about two actionable alerts per spacecraft and week remain to be resolved after analyzing all cases. Therefore, building fully automated techniques for predicting the collision risk can help make the process of avoiding collisions less costly, as the number of false positives could be substantially reduced. In this paper, we present our machine learning techniques for this task which we exploited in the Collision Avoidance Challenge organized by the European Space Agency, in which we took the seventh place as the DunderMifflin Team (out of 97 registered participants).}

In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach for multiple-image super-resolution that is independent from the number of available low-resolution images of the scene. It is in contrast to other deep networks which are crafted to deal with input stacks of a constant size, hence are not applicable once the number of low-resolution images varies. The experiments showed that our technique not only outperforms other single- and multiple-image super-resolution algorithms, but also it is lightweight and delivers instant operation, thus can be deployed in hardware-constrained environments.",

abstract = {Support vector machines (SVMs) have been exploited in a plethora of real-life classification and regression tasks, and are one of the most researched supervised learners. However, their generalization abilities strongly depend on the pivotal hyperparameters of the classifier, alongside its training dataset. Also, the training process is computationally and memory expensive, hence learning multiple SVMs to grid-search the hyperparameter space is infeasible in practice. In this paper, we address the problem of optimizing SVMs for binary classification of difficult datasets, including very large and extremely imbalanced cases. We propose an evolutionary technique that simultaneously optimizes the critical SVM aspects, including the training sample, kernel functions, and features. Also, we introduce a co-evolutionary scheme that allows us to guide the search in a competitive way to the highest-quality solutions. Our extensive experimental study performed over more than 120 benchmarks showed that the proposed algorithm outperforms popular supervised learners, as well as other techniques for optimizing SVMs reported in the literature.}

In this work, we explore the possibilities of extracting discriminative features directly from the dynamics of facial action units to differentiate between genuine and posed smiles. We report the results of our experimental study which shows that the proposed features offer competitive performance to those based on facial landmark analysis and on textural descriptors extracted from spatial-temporal blocks. We make these features publicly available for the UvA-NEMO and BBC databases, which will allow other researchers to further improve the classification scores, while preserving the interpretation capabilities attributed to the use of facial action units. Moreover, we have developed a new technique for identifying the smile phases, which is robust against the noise and allows for continuous analysis of facial videos.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the problem of the identification of undesirable events is discussed. Such events can be poorly represented in the historical data, and it is predominantly impossible to learn from past examples. The discussed issue is considered in the work in the context of two use cases in which vibration and temperature measurements collected by wireless sensors are analysed. These use cases include crushers at a coal-fired power plant and gantries in a steelworks converter. The awareness, resulting from the cooperation with industry, of the need for a system that works in cold start conditions and does not flood the machine operator with alarms was the motivation for proposing a new predictive maintenance method. The proposed solution is based on the methods of outlier identification. These methods are applied to the collected data that was transformed into a multidimensional feature vector. The novelty of the proposed solution stems from the creation of a methodology for the reduction of false positive alarms, which was applied to a system identifying undesirable events. This methodology is based on the adaptation of the system to the analysed data, the interaction with the dispatcher, and the use of the XAI (eXplainable Artificial Intelligence) method. The experiments performed on several data sets showed that the proposed method reduced false alarms by 90.25% on average in relation to the performance of the stand-alone outlier detection method. The obtained results allowed for the implementation of the developed method to a system operating in a real industrial facility. The conducted research may be valuable for systems with a cold start problem where frequent alarms can lead to discouragement and disregard for the system by the user.},

The awareness, resulting from the cooperation with industry, of the need for a system that works in cold start conditions and does not flood the machine operator with alarms was the motivation for proposing a new predictive maintenance method. The proposed solution is based on the methods of outlier identification. These methods are applied to the collected data that was transformed into a multidimensional feature vector. The novelty of the proposed solution stems from the creation of a methodology for the reduction of false positive alarms, which was applied to a system identifying undesirable events. This methodology is based on the adaptation of the system to the analysed data, the interaction with the dispatcher, and the use of the XAI (eXplainable Artificial Intelligence) method. The experiments performed on several data sets showed that the proposed method reduced false alarms by 90.25% on average in relation to the performance of the stand-alone outlier detection method. The obtained results allowed for the implementation of the developed method to a system operating in a real industrial facility. The conducted research may be valuable for systems with a cold start problem where frequent alarms can lead to discouragement and disregard for the system by the user.},

abstract = {In data sets some attributes may have higher or lower importance. One of the tools used for data analysis of such datasets are subspace neuro-fuzzy systems. They elaborate fuzzy rules to describe data sets. In subspace neuro-fuzzy systems fuzzy rules exist in subspaces defined with subsets of attributes. In the paper we propose a novel fuzzy biclustering algorithm that groups both objects and attributes in fuzzy clusters. In that way we create a subspace fuzzy rule base for a subspace fuzzy system. The paper is accompanied with numerical examples that show this approach can lead to better generalisation (and thus lower data prediction errors) with preserved interpretation of fuzzy models.}

In this paper, we propose a fully-automated, end-to-end system for DCE-MRI analysis of brain tumors. Our deep learning-powered technique does not require any user interaction, it yields reproducible results, and it is rigorously validated against benchmark and clinical data. Also, we introduce a cubic model of the vascular input function used for pharmacokinetic modeling which significantly decreases the fitting error when compared with the state of the art, alongside a real-time algorithm for determination of the vascular input region. An extensive experimental study, backed up with statistical tests, showed that our system delivers state-of-the-art results while requiring less than 3 min to process an entire input DCE-MRI study using a single GPU."

We illustrate this dichotomy, and more generally the overlaps between different properties related to LCRs, using examples. We argue that statistical measures alone cannot capture all structural aspects of LCRs and recommend the combined usage of a variety of predictive tools and measurements. While the methodologies available to study LCRs are already very advanced, we foresee that a more comprehensive annotation of sequences in the databases will enable the improvement of predictions and a better understanding of the evolution and the connection between structure and function of LCRs. This will require the use of standards for the generation and exchange of data describing all aspects of LCRs.There are multiple definitions for low complexity regions (LCRs) in protein sequences.

It means that conclusions and observations are based on reduced data, as usually by discretisation some information is discarded. The paper presents a different approach, with taking advantage of discretisation executed after data mining. In the described study firstly decision rules were induced from real-valued features. Secondly, data sets were discretised. Using categories found for attributes, in the third step conditions included in inferred rules were translated into discrete domain. The properties and performance of rule classifiers were tested in the domain of stylometric analysis of texts, where writing styles were defined through quantitative attributes of continuous nature. The performed experiments show that the proposed processing leads to sets of rules with significantly reduced sizes while maintaining quality of predictions, and allows to test many data discretisation methods at the acceptable computational costs.},

	abstract="Methane hazard assessment is an important aspect of coal mining, influencing the safety of miners and work efficiency. Calculation of the methane hazard rate requires specialized equipment, which might be not fully available at the monitored place and consequently might require manual measurements by miners. The lack of measurements can be also caused by a device failure, thus hampering continuous evaluation of the methane rate. In this paper we address this problem by constructing a fuzzy system being able to calculate the methane hazard rate in a continuous manner and deal with data incompleteness. We examine the effectiveness of different fuzzy clustering algorithms in our system and compare the proposed system to other state-of-the-art methods. The extensive experiments show that the proposed method is characterized by superior accuracy when compared to other methods.",

The over- and under-sampling methods help to tackle this issue, however they often have serious shortcomings. In this paper different methods of class balancing, especially those obtained by undersampling, are analyzed. Besides, a new solution is presented. The method is oriented toward finding and thinning clusters of majority class examples. Removing observations from high-density areas can lead to a less loss of information than in the case of removing individual examples or these from less-density areas. Such approach makes the distribution of examples more even. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through extensive comparisons to other undersampling methods with the use of eighteen public datasets. The results of experiments show that in many cases the proposed solution allows to achieve better performance than other tested techniques."

Despite the high prediction rate of this technique in a wide range of real applications, the efficiency of SVM and its classification performance highly depends on the hyperparameters setting as well as the selection of feature subset. Moreover, high memory and computational complexity of SVM training can be a limiting factor for its application on huge dataset. In this work we propose a novel memetic algorithm for support vector machine called SE-SVM to address mentioned problems. We use evolutionary techniques that optimize hyperparameters and select features and training set simultaneously. The algorithm is applied to seven datasets. All of that datasets are binary classification problem. We compare the SE-SVM to different evolutionary algorithms, random search techniques and other well-established classifiers. The experimental results show that the end result obtained by SE-SVM achieves high classification performance with a shorter training and classification time.",

	abstract = "Background and Objective
	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an indispensable tool in diagnosing brain-tumor patients. Automated tumor segmentation is being widely researched to accelerate the MRI analysis and allow clinicians to precisely plan treatment—accurate delineation of brain tumors is a critical step in assessing their volume, shape, boundaries, and other characteristics. However, it is still a very challenging task due to inherent MR data characteristics and high variability, e.g., in tumor sizes or shapes. We present a new deep learning approach for accurate brain tumor segmentation which can be trained from small and heterogeneous datasets annotated by a human reader (providing high-quality ground-truth segmentation is very costly in practice).
	Methods
	In this paper, we present a new deep learning technique for segmenting brain tumors from fluid attenuation inversion recovery MRI. Our technique exploits fully convolutional neural networks, and it is equipped with a battery of augmentation techniques that make the algorithm robust against low data quality, and heterogeneity of small training sets. We train our models using only positive (tumorous) examples, due to the limited amount of available data.
	Results
	Our algorithm was tested on a set of stage II-IV brain-tumor patients (image data collected using MAGNETOM Prisma 3T, Siemens). Rigorous experiments, backed up with statistical tests, revealed that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approach (utilizing hand-crafted features) in terms of segmentation accuracy, offers very fast training and instant segmentation (analysis of an image takes less than a second). Building our deep model is 1.3 times faster compared with extracting features for extremely randomized trees, and this training time can be controlled. Finally, we showed that too aggressive data augmentation may lead to deteriorated performance of the model, especially in the fixed-budget training (with maximum numbers of training epochs).
	Conclusions
	Our method yields the better performance when compared with the state of the art method which utilizes hand-crafted features. In addition, our deep network can be effectively applied to difficult (small, imbalanced, and heterogeneous) datasets, offers controllable training time, and infers in real-time."

	abstract="Super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) is aimed at increasing image spatial resolution from multiple images presenting the same scene or from a single image based on the learned relation between low and high resolution. Emergence of deep learning allowed for improving single-image SRR significantly in the last few years, and a variety of deep convolutional neural networks of different depth and complexity were proposed for this purpose. However, although there are usually some comparisons reported in the papers introducing new deep models for SRR, such experimental studies are somehow limited. First, the networks are often trained using different training data, and/or prepared in a different way. Second, the validation is performed for artificially-degraded images, which does not correspond to the real-world conditions. In this paper, we report the results of our extensive experimental study to compare several state-of-the-art SRR techniques which exploit deep neural networks. We train all the networks using the same training setup and validate them using several datasets of different nature, including real-life scenarios. This allows us to draw interesting conclusions that may be helpful for selecting the most appropriate deep architecture for a given SRR scenario, as well as for creating new SRR solutions.",

The reduction of sequencing costs implies a need for algorithms able to process increasing amounts of generated data in reasonable time.We present Whisper, an accurate and high-performant mapping tool, based on the idea of sorting reads and then mapping them against suffix arrays for the reference genome and its reverse complement. Employing task and data parallelism as well as storing temporary data on disk result in superior time efficiency at reasonable memory requirements. Whisper excels at large NGS read collections, in particular Illumina reads with typical WGS coverage. The experiments with real data indicate that our solution works in about 15\\% of the time needed by the well-known BWA-MEM and Bowtie2 tools at a comparable accuracy, validated in a variant calling pipeline.Whisper is available for free from https://github.com/refresh-bio/Whisper or http://sun.aei.polsl.pl/REFRESH/Whisper/.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

The ability to utilize multiple different measurement techniques in order to provide a comprehensive view on the studied processes is becoming a standard in molecular biology and medicine, increasing the need for the development of new strategies used for handling various types of data in a single environment. To address this need we developed a remotely accessible BioTest platform which allows to process multi-omics data, obtained using various measurement techniques, including next-generation sequencing (NGS), oligonucleotide microarrays, and mass spectrometry. This allows to process various biomedical data from genomic level, trough transcriptomics, up to the proteomic level on a scalable environment that can handle even the largest datasets. Integrated version control for library files and intermediate results as well as the possibility of designing workflows comprised of various algorithms, ensures that all of the results are highly reproducible.

While the methodologies available to study LCRs are already very advanced, we foresee that a more comprehensive annotation of sequences in the databases will enable the improvement of predictions and a better understanding of the evolution and the connection between structure and function of LCRs.

This multi-level problem can lead to errors in genome and protein databases that are often not recognized or acknowledged. As a consequence, end users working with sequences with repetitive regions are faced with ‘ready-to-use’ deposited data whose trustworthiness is difficult to determine, let alone to quantify. Here, we provide a review of the problems associated with tandem repeat sequences that originate from different stages during the sequencing-assembly-annotation-deposition workflow, and that may proliferate in public database repositories affecting all downstream analyses. As a case study, we provide examples of the Atlantic cod genome, whose sequencing and assembly were hindered by a particularly high prevalence of tandem repeats. We complement this case study with examples from other species, where mis-annotations and sequencing errors have propagated into protein databases. With this review, we aim to raise the awareness level within the community of database users, and alert scientists working in the underlying workflow of database creation that the data they omit or improperly assemble may well contain important biological information valuable to others.}",

		abstract="It is well known that discretisation of datasets in some cases may improve the quality of a decision system. Such effects were observed many times during experiments conducted in stylometry domain when authorship attribution tasks were performed. However, some experiments delivered results worse than expected when all attributes in datasets were discretised. Therefore, the idea to test decision systems where only part of attributes is discretised arose. For the selection of attributes to be discretised the greedy forward and backward sequential selection methods were proposed and deeply investigated. Different supervised and unsupervised discretisation methods were employed. The Naive Bayes classifier was selected as the inducer in the decision system. The relation between the subsequent subsets of attributes being discretised and the performance of the decision system was observed. The research proved that there is the maximum of the measure of system quality in respect to the series of subsets of attributes being discretised, generated during the sequential selection processes. Therefore, the attempts to find the optimal subsets of attributes to be discretised are reasonable.",

		abstract={Ranking is a strategy widely used for estimating relevance or importance of available characteristic features. Depending on the applied methodology, variables are assessed individually or as subsets, by some statistics referring to information theory, machine learning algorithms, or specialised procedures that execute systematic search through the feature space. The information about importance of attributes can be used in the pre-processing step of initial data preparation, to remove irrelevant or superfluous elements. It can also be employed in post-processing, for optimisation of already constructed classifiers. The chapter describes research on the latter approach, involving filtering inferred decision rules while exploiting ranking positions and scores of features. The optimised rule classifiers were applied in the domain of stylometric analysis of texts for the task of binary authorship attribution.},

		abstract={Super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) allows for producing a high-resolution (HR) image from a set of low-resolution (LR) observations. The majority of existing methods require tuning a number of hyper-parameters which control the reconstruction process and configure the imaging model that is supposed to reflect the relation between high and low resolution. In this paper, we demonstrate that the reconstruction process is very sensitive to the actual relation between LR and HR images, and we argue that this is a substantial obstacle in deploying SRR in practice. We propose to search the hyper-parameter space using a genetic algorithm (GA), thus adapting to the actual relation between LR and HR, which has not been reported in the literature so far. The results of our extensive experimental study clearly indicate that our GA improves the capacities of SRR. Importantly, the GA converges to different values of the hyper-parameters depending on the applied degradation procedure, which is confirmed using statistical tests.},

		abstract={Feature extraction is the first step in building real-life classification engines---it aims at elaborating features to characterize objects that are to be labeled by a trained model. Time-consuming feature extraction requires domain expertise to effectively design features. Deep neural networks (DNNs) appeared as a remedy in this context---their shallow layers perform representation learning, being an automated discovery of various-level features that robustly represent objects. However, the representations that are being learnt are still extremely difficult to interpret, and DNNs are prone to memorizing small datasets. In this paper, we introduce evolvable deep features (EDFs)---a DNN is used to extract automatic features that undergo genetic feature selection. Such evolved features are fed into a supervised learner. The experiments, backed up with statistical tests, performed on multi- and binary-class sets showed that our approach automatically learns object representations, greatly reduces the number of features without deteriorating the performance of trained models, and can even boost their classification performance.},

		abstract = {Most naturally-occurring physical phenomena are examples of nonlinear dynamic systems, the functioning of which attracts many researchers seeking to unveil their nature. The research presented in this paper is aimed at exploring eye movement dynamic features in terms of the existence of chaotic nature. Nonlinear time series analysis methods were used for this purpose. Two time series features were studied: fractal dimension and entropy, by utilising the embedding theory. The methods were applied to the data collected during the experiment with �jumping point� stimulus. Eye movements were registered by means of the Jazz-novo eye tracker. One thousand three hundred and ninety two (1392) time series were defined, based on the horizontal velocity of eye movements registered during imposed, prolonged fixations. In order to conduct detailed analysis of the signal and identify differences contributing to the observed patterns of behaviour in time scale, fractal dimension and entropy were evaluated in various time series intervals. The influence of the noise contained in the data and the impact of the utilized filter on the obtained results were also studied. The low pass filter was used for the purpose of noise reduction with a 50 Hz cut-off frequency, estimated by means of the Fourier transform and all concerned methods were applied to time series before and after noise reduction. These studies provided some premises, which allow perceiving eye movements as observed chaotic data: characteristic of a space-time separation plot, low and non-integer time series dimension, and the time series entropy characteristic for chaotic systems.},

Its main objective is to minimize the number of vehicles, and the secondary objective is to minimize the distance traveled during the service. In this paper, we propose the longest common subsequence based selective route exchange crossover (LCS-SREX), and apply this operator in the memetic algorithm (MA) for the PDPTW. Also, we suggest the new solution representation which helps handle the crossover efficiently. Extensive experimental study performed on the benchmark set showed that using LCS-SREX leads to very high-quality feasible solutions. The analysis is backed with the statistical tests to verify the importance of the elaborated results. Finally, we report one new world's best routing schedule found using a parallel version of the MA exploiting LCS-SREX.},

		abstract={Support vector machines (SVMs) have been found highly helpful in solving numerous pattern recognition tasks. Although it is challenging to train SVMs from large data sets, this obstacle may be mitigated by selecting a small, yet representative, subset of the entire training set. Another crucial and deeply-investigated problem consists in selecting the SVM model. There have been a plethora of methods proposed to effectively deal with these two problems treated independently, however to the best of our knowledge, it was not explored how to effectively combine these two processes. It is a noteworthy observation that depending on the subset selected for training, a different SVM model may be optimal, hence performing these two operations simultaneously is potentially beneficial. In this paper, we propose a new method to select both the training set and the SVM model, using a genetic algorithm which alternately optimizes two different populations. We demonstrate that our approach is competitive with sequential optimization of the hyperparameters followed by selecting the training set. We report the results obtained for several benchmark data sets and we visualize the results elaborated for artificial sets of 2D points.},

		abstract={The eye movement analysis undertaken in many research is conducted to better understand the biology of the brain and oculomotor system functioning. The studies presented in this paper considered eye movement signal as an output of a nonlinear dynamic system and are concentrated on determining the chaotic behaviour existence. The system nature was examined during a fixation, one of key components of eye movement signal, taking its vertical velocity into account. The results were compared with those obtained in the case of the horizontal direction. This comparison showed that both variables provide the similar representation of the underlying dynamics. In both cases, the analysis revealed the chaotic nature of eye movement for the first 200 ms, just after a stimulus position change. Subsequently, the signal characteristic tended to be the convergent one, however, in some cases, depending on a part of the fixation duration the chaotic behaviour was still observable.},

In this study we present the approach for functional interpretation of gene or protein sets with clusters of Gene Ontology terms. We analyze transcription profiles of human cell line K562 and we show that clustering allows grouping functionally related GO terms and therefore obtaining more concise and comprehensive description. By applying cluster-specific data aggregation tool we are able to calculate statistics for the individual clusters of GO terms and compare the number of differentially expressed genes between two sample pairs.

Applied in a number of fields, it has become particularly useful in medicine to estimate the survival rate of patients on the basis of their condition, examination results, and undergoing treatment. The recent developments in the next generation sequencing open new opportunities in survival study as they allow vast amount of genome-, transcriptome-, and proteome-related features to be investigated. These include single nucleotide and structural variants, expressions of genes and microRNAs, DNA methylation, and many others.},

		abstract = {Osteoporosis is a frequent bone disease without typical early symptoms but with serious complications e.g. low-energy bone fractures. Patients with risk factors should be screened for proper diagnosis as early as possible. Unfortunately, the registered medical data are often highly imbalanced. That is why the machine-based data processing is difficult or even impossible. Considering this, our goal was to search for the best method of coping with the problem of imbalancing in relation to the analysed data regarding the osteoporotic patients. Therefore, we checked several paradigms of classifiers in synergy with preprocessing techniques to address the inner skewed class distribution of the data. In the source dataset 92.6% of instances related to patients without any fractures (negative cases) and only 7.41% to patients (positive cases) who reported at least one fracture. To alleviate class imbalance there were examined not only data-level methods which in fact modify the input dataset, but also ensemble ones that strengthen the results of the base algorithms. In the first group the under- and over-sampling methods were used, such as random undersampling, edited nearest neighbours and synthetic minority over-sampling techniques, while in the second one � a range of methods based on various subsets of training data were analysed. Also various combinations of the above mentioned were investigated. Additionally, we propose the way how to find the balancing level which, without excessive distortion of the input, raw data, will give the appropriate classification efficiency. The aim of our experiment was to identify which of an undersampling or an oversampling approach with reference to the simple and the ensemble-based classifiers allows to achieve the best results. The outcomes of the comparative studies concerning imbalancing problem with regard to our dataset showed that the highest efficiency was achieved while using the synthetic minority over-sampling technique and RandomForest classifier. As far as the optimal balancing level is concerned, we empirically determined that 300% oversampling with the synthetic minority over-sampling method combined with edited nearest neighbours undersampling allowed to gain the required precision of classification.}

The proposed Fuzzy Weighted C-Ordered Mean (FWCOM) clustering algorithm elaborates clusters in soft subspaces. In each cluster each attribute is assigned a weight from interval [0,1]. Each attribute has its individual weight (importance) in each cluster. The proposed algorithm applies the ordering technique to effectively reduce the influence of outliers and noise.

The application of more advanced techniques provides the opportunity to gain wider knowledge and deeper understanding of the human body and mind functioning. The eye tracking methods used to register eye movement to find the direction and targets of a person's gaze are well in line with the nature of the topic. By providing methods for capturing and processing images of the eye it has become possible not only to reveal abnormalities in eye functioning but also to conduct cognitive studies focused on learning about peoples� emotions and intentions. The usefulness of the application of eye tracking technology in medicine was proved in many research studies. The aim of this paper is to give an insight into those studies and the way they utilize eye imaging in medical applications. These studies were differentiated taking their purpose and experimental paradigms into account. Additionally, methods for eye movement visualization and metrics for its quantifying were presented. Apart from presenting the state of the art, the aim of the paper was also to point out possible applications of eye tracking in medicine that have not been exhaustively investigated yet, and are going to be a perspective long-term direction of research.}

In real life data sets not always all attributes (dimensions) of data are relevant or have the same importance. Some of them may be noninformative or unnecessary. This is why subspace technique is applied. Unfortunately this technique is vulnerable to noise and outliers that are often present in real life data. The paper describes a subspace neuro-fuzzy system with data ordering technique. Data items are ordered and assigned with typicalities. Data items with low typicalities have lower influence on the elaborated fuzzy model. This technique makes fuzzy models more robust to noise and outliers.

In particular, we investigate and compare practical methods for the assessment of seismic hazards using analytical models constructed based on sensory data and domain knowledge. For our case study, we use a rich data set collected during a period of over five years from several active Polish coal mines. We focus on comparing the prediction quality between expert methods which serve as a standard in the coal mining industry and state-of-the-art machine learning methods for mining high-dimensional time series data. We describe an international data mining challenge organized to facilitate our study. We also demonstrate a technique which we employed to construct an ensemble of regression models able to outperform other approaches used by participants of the challenge. Finally, we explain how we utilized the data obtained during the competition for the purpose of research on the cold start problem in deploying decision support systems at new mining sites.}

			abstract = {Eye tracking is an increasingly popular technique that may be used for a variety of applications including user experience analysis, usability engineering and interactive games. Moreover, this technique may be useful inter alia in education, psychological tests and medical diagnosis. Video-based oculography (VOG) is the most commonly utilized technique because it is non-intrusive, can be applied in users' natural environments and is relatively cheap as it uses only basic cameras. There are already well-established methods for eye detection using still images registered by a camera. However, to be usable in the estimation of gaze position, eye image features must be associated with the place where an observer is looking; this typically requires the evaluation of several parameters during a process called calibration. The parameters significantly influence the quality of the analysis of subsequently collected data, thus they should be adjusted to the eye tracker used, the user and the environment. The purpose of this study is to present various calibration techniques and introduce an open, extendable and ready-to-use software application that implements these techniques. This software implements several algorithms already described in the literature and introduces some novel techniques. It provides the opportunity to compare different methods including plug-in self-developed filters and optimization algorithms; it also allows for analysis of results.}
